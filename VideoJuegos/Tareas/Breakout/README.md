The Rules and Objective:
Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks 
and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a life and will have a 1 second cooldown to regain composure and try again. 
The player has three lifes to try to clear the screen of bricks, if they don't, they will be greeted by a "game over" showing they have lost the game.
